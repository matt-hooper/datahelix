# Generation types

The generator supports the following data generation types

* Random (_default_)
* Interesting

## Random
Generate some random data that abides by the given set of constraints. This mode has the potential to repeat data points, it does not keep track of values that have already been emitted.

Examples:

| Constraint | Emitted valid data |Emitted violating data |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `Field 1 > 10 AND Field 1 < 20` | _(any values > 10 & < 20)_ | _(any values <= 10 or >= 20)_ |
| `Field 1 in set [A, B, C]` | _(A, B or C in any order, repeated as needed)_ | `null` |

Notes:
- Random generation of data is infinite and is limited to 1000 by default, use `--max-rows` to enable generation of more data.


## Interesting
See [this document](https://github.com/ScottLogic/datahelix/wiki/Interesting-data-generation) for more details on the _interesting generation mode_.

The values that are generated by the generator are shown in the matrix below. `granularTo` does not have any bearing on whether the field represents integer or decimal values. If no `ofType` constraint exists then interesting values from _all_ data types can be emitted.

| Data type | where there are no constraints for the field <br /> _(or only `ofType` and/or `not(is null)`)_ | where constraints exist for the field <br /> _(beyond `ofType` and `not(is null)`)_ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **string** | "Lorem Ipsum" | a string as short as possible given the intersection of other constraints <br /> a string as long as possible given the intersection of other constraints <br /> If a containsRegex or matchingRegex is present, use this to inform the characters that are included in the shortest/longest strings. Otherwise repeat a `<space>` character for the contents of both strings <br /> |
| **numeric (integer values)** <br /> where all present numeric constraints (if any) contain whole numbers and no decimal points | -100000000000000000000 <br /> 0 <br /> 100000000000000000000 | _A unique set of:_ <br /> the lowest possible value or -100000000000000000000 <br /> 0 (if permitted) <br /> the highest possible value or 100000000000000000000 |
| **numeric (decimal values)** <br /> where some numeric constraints contain a decimal point (even if the fraction is 0, e.g. 10.0) | -100000000000000000000 <br /> 0 <br /> 100000000000000000000 | _A unique set of:_ <br /> the 2 lowest possible values or -100000000000000000000, -99999999999999999999<br /> 0 (if permitted) <br /> the 2 highest possible values or 99999999999999999999, 100000000000000000000 |
| **datetime** | 0000-01-01T00:00:00.000 <br /> 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999 | _A unique set of:_ <br /> the earliest possible date or 0000-01-01T00:00:00.000 <br /> the latest possible date or 9999-12-31T:23:59:59.999 |
| **string** (`aValid ISIN`) | "GB0000000009" <br /> "GB00JJJJJJ45" <br /> "US0000000002" | NA - this constraint has no other constraints that can be used in conjunction with it - see [#488](https://github.com/ScottLogic/datahelix/issues/488) |

`null` is considered an interesting value; it will be emitted where permitted (i.e. where there is no `not(is null)` constraint applied to the field)

### Conditional constraints
Any value/s mentioned within an `if` or `anyOf` will be considered interesting whether the field is constrained or not. Consider the following profile:
```
field1 greaterThanOrEqual 0
field1 lessThan 10
field1 ofType integer

if field1 equalTo 5 then
  field2 equalTo "a"
```

Given the table above the interesting values for `field1` would be `0` & `9`. To ensure the consequence of the `if` constraint is met (`field2 equalTo "a"`), at least once, `5` is included as an interesting value. As such the above profile would emit `0`, `5` & `9` for `field1`.

### Sets
All values of the `inSet` constraint is used (the single value in an `equalTo` constraint) are considered interesting. There is no discrimination over the values emitted for these sets.
