Feature: User can specify that a number is of type integer and does not have any decimal places

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "integer"
    And foo is anything but null

### Numeric Constraints

  Scenario: Greater than constraint with integer type produces valid integers
    Given foo is greater than 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 11  |
      | 12  |
      | 13  |
      | 14  |
      | 15  |

  Scenario: Greater than or equal to constraint with integer type produces valid integers
    Given foo is greater than or equal to 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 10  |
      | 11  |
      | 12  |
      | 13  |
      | 14  |

#594 - Change this to descending order?
  Scenario: Less than or equal to constraint with integer type produces valid integers
    Given foo is less than or equal to 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                    |
      | -100000000000000000000 |
      | -99999999999999999999  |
      | -99999999999999999998  |
      | -99999999999999999997  |
      | -99999999999999999996  |

  Scenario: Equal to constraint with integer type produces valid integer
    Given foo is equal to 10
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 10  |

  Scenario: Equal to constraint with integer type rejects invalid integer (decimal)
    Given foo is equal to 10.1
    Then no data is created

  Scenario: In Set constraint with integer type only produces valid integers
    Given foo is in set:
      | 1   |
      | 1.1 |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 1   |

  Scenario: Contradictory granular to constraint with integer type only produces valid integers
    Given foo is in set:
      | 1   |
      | 1.1 |
    And foo is granular to 0.1
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 1   |

  Scenario: Granular to constraint does not affect integer
    Given foo is greater than 10
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    And foo is granular to 0.01
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 11  |
      | 12  |
      | 13  |
      | 14  |
      | 15  |
