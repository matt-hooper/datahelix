Feature: User can specify that a string length is longer than, a specified number of characters

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request that includes positive value should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 5
    And foo is in set:
      | "aaaa"   |
      | "aaaaa"  |
      | "aaaaaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo      |
      | null     |
      | "aaaaaa" |

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request that includes the value zero should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | "a"  |

  Scenario: 'longerThan' a negative number should fail with an error
    Given foo is longer than -5
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: longerThan constraint must have an operand/value >= 0, currently is -5"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' a decimal number with an non-zero mantissa should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than 1.1
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be an integer but was a decimal with value `1.1`"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' a string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than "Test"
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be a Integer but was a String with value `Test`"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' an empty string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than ""
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be a Integer but was a String with value ``"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' whitespace should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than " "
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be a Integer but was a String with value ` `"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' null should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than null
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be set to a value"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: 'longerThan' a decimal number with a zero mantissa should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 2.0
    And foo is in set:
      | 1.0   |
      | 2.0   |
      | "a"   |
      | "aaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | null  |
      | 1.0   |
      | 2.0   |
      | "aaa" |

  Scenario: Multiple non-contradictory 'longerThan' requests should be successful

    And foo is longer than 1
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"   |
      | "aa"  |
      | "aaa" |
      | "aab" |

  Scenario: longerThan with maximum permitted value should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 999
    And the generation strategy is random
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows
    And foo is anything but null
    Then foo contains strings of length between 1000 and 1000 inclusively

  Scenario: longerThan with value larger than maximum permitted should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than 1000
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: longerThan constraint must have an operand/value <= 999, currently is 1000"

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request with a value less than implicit max (255) should generate data of length between value and 255
    Given foo is of type "string"
    And foo is longer than 254
    And the generator can generate at most 20 rows
    Then foo contains strings of length between 255 and 255 inclusively

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request with a value equal to the implicit max (255) should generate data of length between 256 and hard maximum (1000)
    Given foo is of type "string"
    And foo is longer than 255
    And the generator can generate at most 20 rows
    Then foo contains strings of length between 256 and 1000 inclusively
