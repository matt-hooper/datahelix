Feature: Hard contradictions produce nothing, soft contradictions produce only null.

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is RANDOM
    And there is a field foo

### Hard Contradictions ###
  Scenario: Contradicting types, disallowing 'null', should not produce any data.
    Given foo is anything but null
    And foo is of type "string"
    And foo is of type "integer"
    Then no data is created

  Scenario: Contradicting inferred and actual types should not produce any data.
    Given foo is anything but null
    And foo is of type "integer"
    And foo is less than 1
    And foo is greater than 0
    Then no data is created

### Soft Contradictions ###
  Scenario: Contradicting types, but allowing 'null', should produce only 'null' values.
    Given foo is of type "string"
    And foo is of type "integer"
    And the generator can generate at most 2 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | null |
