Feature: User can specify that a datetime date is lower than, but not equal to, a specified threshold

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "datetime"

  Scenario: Running a 'before' request over a year threshold should be successful
    Given foo is before 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
