  Scenario: Running an 'inSet' request including a string over the maximum length should throw an error
    Given there is a field foo
    And the maximum string length is 1000
    And foo is in set:

    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: set contains a string longer than maximum permitted length, was: 1001, max-length: 1000"
