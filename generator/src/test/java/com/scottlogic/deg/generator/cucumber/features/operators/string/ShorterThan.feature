Feature: User can specify that a string length is lower than, a specified number of characters

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "string"

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number to specify a the length of a generated string should be successful
    Given foo is shorter than 5
    And foo is matching regex /[x]{1,5}/
    And the generator can generate at most 5 rows
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo    |
      | null   |
      | "x"    |
      | "xx"   |
      | "xxx"  |
      | "xxxx" |

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number (zero) to specify a the length of a generated string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than 0
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: shorterThan constraint must have an operand/value >= 1, currently is 0"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number (negative number) to specify a the length of a generated string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than -1
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: shorterThan constraint must have an operand/value >= 1, currently is -1"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a number (decimal number) to specify a the length of a generated string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than 1.1
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be an integer but was a decimal with value `1.1`"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using a string (number) to specify a the length of a generated string should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than "5"
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be a Integer but was a String with value `5`"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using an empty string "" to specify a the length of a generated string field should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than ""
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be a Integer but was a String with value ``"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running a 'shorterThan' request using null to specify a the length of a generated string field should fail with an error message
    Given foo is shorter than null
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be set to a value"
    And no data is created
